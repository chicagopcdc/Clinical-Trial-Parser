Patients who will exceed a lifetime anthracycline exposure of >550 mg/m2 daunorubicin or equivalent (or >400 mg/m2 daunorubicin or equivalent in the event of prior mediastinal radiation) if they receive the maximum potential exposure to anthracyclines per protocol (including both induction and consolidation cycles. Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 3 years and are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 3 years: cervical cancer in situ, breast DCIS, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Current clinical central nervous system (CNS) symptoms deemed by the investigator to be related to leukemic CNS involvement (no lumbar puncture required, clinical assessment per investigator's judgment is sufficient).

Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, clinically ongoing or active infection requiring intravenous antibiotics (IV antibiotics are allowed if infection is deemed to be controlled), symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Known GI disease or GI procedures that could interfere with the oral absorption or tolerance of the study drugs. Examples include, but are not limited to partial gastrectomy, history of small intestine surgery, and celiac disease. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because venetoclax and azacitidine, along with standard induction chemotherapy, carries the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with venetoclax as well as azacitidine, cytarabine, daunorubicin and idarubicin, breastfeeding should be avoided. Confirmation that the subject is not pregnant must be established by a negative serum ß-human chorionic gonadotropin (ß-hCG) pregnancy test result obtained during screening.

Supportive care therapy for MDS (growth factors, transfusions) will not be considered as prior therapy for MDS/AML and these patients will be enrolled to the frontline cohort of the study if they are otherwise eligible In the absence of rapidly progressing disease, the interval from prior treatment to time of initiation of protocol therapy will be at least 2 weeks or at least 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter). The half-life for the therapy in question will be based on published pharmacokinetic literature (abstracts, manuscripts, investigator brochure's, or drug-administration manuals) and will be documented in the protocol eligibility document. The toxicity from prior therapy should have resolved to grade =< 1, however alopecia and sensory neuropathy grade =< 2 not constituting a safety risk based on investigators judgement is acceptable. The use of chemotherapeutic or anti-leukemic agents is not permitted during the study with the following exceptions: (1) intrathecal (IT) therapy for patients with controlled central nervous system (CNS) leukemia at the discretion of the PI. (2) Use of 1-2 doses of cytarabine (up to 2 g/m^2 each dose) for patients with rapidly proliferative disease is allowed before the start of study therapy and for the first four weeks on therapy. Since the effect of most immuno-oncology (IO)-agents, HMA-therapies, venetoclax may be delayed, use of hydroxyurea for patients with rapidly proliferative disease is allowed on study and before the start of study therapy and will not require a washout. These medications will be recorded in the case-report form Concurrent therapy for CNS prophylaxis or continuation of therapy for controlled CNS disease is permitted. Patients with a known history of CNS disease or leukemic brain metastasis must have been treated locally, have at least 2 consecutive LPs with no evidence of CNS leukemia, and must be clinically stable for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment and have no ongoing neurological symptoms that in the opinion of the treating physician are related to the CNS disease (sequelae that are a consequence of the treatment of the CNS disease are acceptable)	What is your ECOG performance status?	{"id":"88","name":"ecog","value":["0","1","2"],"variableType":"ordinal","score":0.6052631578947368}

NCT02878785	inclusion	numerical	0	Diagnosis of AML based on 2008 WHO criteria. AML may be de novo, following a prior hematologic disorder, including MDS or Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm, and/or therapy-related. PHASES 1 AND 2: Patients with AML that has relapsed after, or is refractory to, first-line therapy, with or without subsequent additional therapy, and are currently considered unfit for, or unlikely to respond to, cytotoxic chemotherapy. PHASE 2 ONLY: Patients previously untreated for AML who are considered unfit for cytotoxic chemotherapy by virtue of performance status, comorbidities, advanced age and/or low likelihood of response based on disease characteristics, or who decline cytotoxic induction chemotherapy. Patients who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT) are eligible provided that they are ≥ 4 weeks from stem cell infusion. Patients who have undergone allogeneic SCT (alloSCT) are eligible if they are ≥ 60 days from stem cell infusion, have no evidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD) > Grade 1, and are ≥ 2 weeks off all immunosuppressive therapy. Previous cytotoxic chemotherapy must have been completed at least 3 weeks and radiotherapy at least 2 weeks prior to Day 1 of treatment on the study, and all adverse events (excluding alopecia) due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier should have recovered to < Grade 1. Patients with hematologic malignancies are expected to have hematologic abnormalities at study entry. Hematologic abnormalities that are thought to be primarily related to leukemia are not considered to be toxicities (AE) and do not need to resolve to < Grade 1. Prior DNA methyl transferase inhibitor administration (azacitidine, decitabine, or guadecitabine) for AML or for antecedent MDS is allowed if this clinical trial is considered the best treatment option, but azacitidine, decitabine, or guadecitabine must have been stopped at least 3 weeks prior to Day 1 of treatment on the study. All biologic agents including hematopoietic growth factors must have been stopped at least 1 week prior to Day 1 of treatment on the study. Age ≥18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of decitabine or talazoparib in patients <18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.

For patients ≤ 17 years of age who are developmentally able, assent or affirmation will be obtained. Age 0-26, inclusive, at time of consent. Diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia, either high-risk (defined below), relapsed or primary refractory, MRD-positive without circulating myeloblasts or active extramedullary disease at the time of transplant. Active marrow disease is permitted. High-risk AML features are defined by the following: RAM phenotype; adverse cytogenetic abnormalities of monosomy 5, monosomy 7, 5q deletion, or other unfavorable prognostic markers according to cytogenetics, FISH, or next generation sequencing (NGS); presence of FLT3 positive internal tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD+), particularly high allelic ratio; treatment-related AML; or positive minimal residual disease (MRD) at end of Induction I. Stem cell sources include bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, or umbilical cord blood. Related bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cell, or cord blood unit: sibling should be HLA-matched at A, B, and DR-B1 loci. Unrelated cord blood unit should be at a minimum of 4/6 matched at antigen level on HLA A and B, and allele level at HLA DR-B1 loci. Unrelated bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell donor should be HLA allele level matched at DR-B1.

for this reason, women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks after the last dose of investigational drug nivolumab; women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG]) within 24 hours prior to the start of nivolumab; women must not be breastfeeding; men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a failure rate of less than 1% per year; men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31 weeks after the last dose of investigational product; women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men) do not require contraception Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal; menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes; in addition, women under the age of 55 must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level less than 40 mIU/mL WOCBP receiving nivolumab will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 23 weeks after the last dose of investigational product; men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31 weeks after the last dose of investigational product; these durations have been calculated using the upper limit of the half-life for nivolumab (25 days) and are based on the protocol requirement that WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 30 days and men who are sexually active with WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 90 days Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she (or the participating partner) should inform the treating physician immediately Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document	What is your Karnofsky score?	{"id":"600","name":"karnofsky_score","unit":"%","lower":{"incl":true,"value":"70"},"variableType":"numerical","score":1}
