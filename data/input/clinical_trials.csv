They may have received transfusions, hematopoietic growth factors or vitamins for an antecedent hematological disorder (AHD) or for AML. Temporary prior measures such as apheresis, ATRA, steroids or hydrea while diagnostic work-up is being performed are allowed and not counted as a prior salvage. Supportive care therapy for MDS (growth factors, transfusions) will not be considered as prior therapy for MDS/AML and these patients will be enrolled to the frontline cohort of the study if they are otherwise eligible
In the absence of rapidly progressing disease, the interval from prior treatment to time of initiation of protocol therapy will be at least 2 weeks or at least 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter). The half-life for the therapy in question will be based on published pharmacokinetic literature (abstracts, manuscripts, investigator brochure's, or drug-administration manuals) and will be documented in the protocol eligibility document. The toxicity from prior therapy should have resolved to grade =< 1, however alopecia and sensory neuropathy grade =< 2 not constituting a safety risk based on investigators judgement is acceptable. The use of chemotherapeutic or anti-leukemic agents is not permitted during the study with the following exceptions: (1) intrathecal (IT) therapy for patients with controlled central nervous system (CNS) leukemia at the discretion of the PI. (2) Use of 1-2 doses of cytarabine (up to 2 g/m^2 each dose) for patients with rapidly proliferative disease is allowed before the start of study therapy and for the first four weeks on therapy. Since the effect of most immuno-oncology (IO)-agents, HMA-therapies, venetoclax may be delayed, use of hydroxyurea for patients with rapidly proliferative disease is allowed on study and before the start of study therapy and will not require a washout. These medications will be recorded in the case-report form
Concurrent therapy for CNS prophylaxis or continuation of therapy for controlled CNS disease is permitted. Patients with a known history of CNS disease or leukemic brain metastasis must have been treated locally, have at least 2 consecutive LPs with no evidence of CNS leukemia, and must be clinically stable for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment and have no ongoing neurological symptoms that in the opinion of the treating physician are related to the CNS disease (sequelae that are a consequence of the treatment of the CNS disease are acceptable)

Donors are excluded when preexisting immunoreactivity is identified that would jeopardize donor hematopoietic cell engraftment. The recommended procedure for patients with 10 of 10 HLA allele level (phenotypic) match is to obtain panel reactive antibody (PRA) screens to class I and class II antigens for all patients before HCT. If the PRA shows > 10% activity, then flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained. The donor should be excluded if any of the cytotoxic cross match assays are positive. For those patients with an HLA class I allele mismatch, flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained regardless of the PRA results. A positive anti-donor cytotoxic crossmatch is an absolute donor exclusion
Patient and donor pairs homozygous at a mismatched allele in the graft rejection vector are considered a two-allele mismatch, i.e., the patient is A*0101 and the donor is A*0102, and this type of mismatch is not allowed

Secondary AML (that is arising from prior myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS]/AML, therapy-related [t]-AML) are also allowed. AML arising from myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), MPN/MDS overlap (including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [CMML]) or another malignancy are NOT allowed. Note 1: Patients must have evidence of bone marrow involvement on aspirate or biopsy. Patients with only extramedullary disease and no bone marrow involvement will be excluded. Note 2: Every effort should be made to get an aspirate for central flow assessment at screening and all subsequent required time points, but in cases where an aspirate cannot be collected-including dry taps-the patient will not be excluded and assessments will be performed on peripheral blood (PB) which should be collected at every time that bone marrow (BM) is collected. Note 3: Some patients with AML require initiation of therapy quickly after diagnosis, and full metaphase karyotype results in some centers can take 2-3 weeks to result. To avoid this issue being an impediment to accrual to study or to cause delays in initiation of therapy in patients who need fast initiation of therapy, we allow use of karyotype and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results (as well as FLT3 results) on samples from blood or marrow that were obtained up to 3 weeks before signing consent for purposes of eligibility and stratification. In any case, results from FISH or karyotype should show if CBF abnormalities are present by time of randomization as the presence of core-binding factor (CBF) abnormalities is a required stratification factor.

Strong CYP3A mechanism-based inhibitors or strong CYP3A inducers and/or P-gp inducers within 7 days, or within 5 times the inhibitor or inducer half-life (whichever is longer), before the first dose of study drug. However, if a patient has a strong indication for fungal prophylaxis, then the moderate CYP3A inhibitors fluconazole or isovuconazole (mold-active) is recommended for prophylaxis, and the TAK-659 dose should be reduced to 60mg, along with increased scrutiny for toxicity. Similarly, if the patient develops a fungal infection during a productive intervention with TAK-659/Ixazomib combination, isovuconazole (mold-active) should be used, along with increased scrutiny for toxicity. In general, the use of these agents is not recommended during the study except in cases where such an AE must be managed, and the intermittent schedule of TAK-659/Ixazomib combination will not prevent profound neutropenia.

Negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential only.
The effects of CIML NK cells and IL-2 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

Patients who recover from such illness may still be eligible, but this must be reviewed with the study PI. A repeat bone marrow examination may be required depending on the timing of recovery. Patients who become critically ill on the planned day of NK cell infusion are excluded if the NK cell infusion cannot be given within 48 hours of the planned day 0.
Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the unknown teratogenic risk of CIML NK cells and IL-2 and with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects by Flu/Cy chemotherapy regimen. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with CIML NK cells and IL-2, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated on this study.
HIV-positive participants are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with anti-retroviral agents used in this study. In addition, these participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.
Individuals with active uncontrolled hepatitis B or C, HIV, or HTLV-1 are ineligible as they are at high risk of lethal treatment-related hepatotoxicity after HSCT.",12,999

The effects of belinostat and/or MLN4924 (pevonedistat) on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because histone deacetylase inhibitors and NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitory agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must use 1 highly effective method and 1 additional (barrier) method of contraception at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent through 4 months after the last dose of study drug (female and male condoms should not be used together). Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) and belinostat administration

Pregnant or nursing. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed within 7 days prior to the start of study therapy.

Note: Pregnant women are excluded from this study because MLN4924 (pevonedistat) is a NEDD8 inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects and because belinostat may cause teratogenicity and/or embryo-fetal lethality by virtue of targeting actively dividing cells. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events (AEs) in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with MLN4924 (pevonedistat) or belinostat, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with MLN4924 (pevonedistat)/belinostat",18,999

Relapsed: >= 5% bone marrow blasts by morphology, reappearance of minimal residual disease (MRD) (> 0.1%) by flow cytometry, reappearance of peripheral blood blasts, or development of extramedullary leukemia after one or more prior lines of therapy. Consolidation regimens, including autologous and allogeneic HCT, do not count as a separate prior line of therapy, (e.g., 7+3 followed by cytarabine consolidation followed by allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) would be considered one prior line of therapy). Note, there is no restriction on the prior number of relapses and prior treatment of relapsed disease is allowed.
Refractory: no complete response (CR) or complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi) after two courses of induction therapy (e.g. therapy with the intent to induce remission).

If there is history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the patient must have been treated and have undetectable HCV viral load.
Patients must be willing to submit blood samples for the integrated biomarker.
Female patients of childbearing potential (i.e. who are not postmenopausal for at least 1 year before screening or are not surgically sterile) must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to the first study drug administration and must agree to practice one highly effective method and one additional effective (barrier) method of contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent through 4 months after the last dose of study drug, or agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Male patients, even if surgically sterilized, must agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period through 4 months after the last dose of study drug, or agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods), withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception.

Patients for whom, in the opinion of the treating physician, azacitidine alone is not an appropriate treatment will be excluded.
Patients must not have documented active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by leukemia. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

Patients must not have severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect their participation in the study.
Pregnant women are ineligible because, as an Nedd8 activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor, MLN4924 (pevonedistat) has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with MLN4924 (pevonedistat), breastfeeding must be discontinued if the mother is treated with MLN4924 (pevonedistat). These potential risks may also apply to azacitidine.
Patients must not have had major surgery within 14 days before the first dose of any study drug or be scheduled for surgery during the study period.

ARMS A-G: RR AML: Patients with AML who are refractory or relapsed (any salvage) with no available therapies or not candidates for available therapies. For patients with prior MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) or myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) who transformed to AML, therapy received for MDS, CMML, or MPN is NOT considered as prior therapy for AML with the exception of MDS or CMML treated with hypomethylating agents (HMAs). Patients with MDS or CMML treated with HMA therapies who progress to AML, and have no available therapies or are not candidates for available therapies, will be eligible at the time of progression to AML.
Prior therapy with hydroxyurea, chemotherapy, biological or targeted therapy (e.g. FLT3 inhibitors, other kinase inhibitors), or hematopoietic growth factors is permitted.
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =< 2.
Total bilirubin =< 2.0 times upper limit of normal (x ULN).
Aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase =< 2.5 x ULN (aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase =< 5.0 x ULN if deemed related to leukemia by the treating physician).
Adequate renal function defined by an estimated creatinine clearance >= 40 mL/min according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula (or local institutional standard method).
Patients must provide written informed consent.
In the absence of rapidly progressive disease, the interval from prior treatment to the time of initiation of protocol therapy will be at least 14 days for prior anti-leukemic therapy, with the exception of hydroxyurea as noted below, OR at least 5 half-lives for cytotoxic/noncytotoxic agents, whichever is shorter. The half-life for the therapy in question will be based on published pharmacokinetic literature (abstracts, manuscripts, investigator brochure's, or drug-administration manuals) and will be documented in the protocol eligibility document. The toxicity from prior therapy should have resolved to grade =< 1, however alopecia and sensory neuropathy grade =< 2 not constituting a safety risk based on investigators judgement is acceptable. Since the effect of most IO-agents, HMA-therapies, SMO-inhibitors, venetoclax may be delayed, use of hydroxyurea for patients with rapidly proliferative disease is allowed before the start of study therapy and will not require a washout.
Concurrent therapy for central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis or continuation of therapy for controlled CNS disease is permitted. Patients with a known history of CNS disease or leukemic brain metastasis must have been treated locally, have at least 3 consecutive lumbar punctures (LPs) with no evidence of CNS leukemia, and must be clinically stable for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment and have no ongoing neurological symptoms that in the opinion of the treating physician are related to the CNS disease (sequelae that are a consequence of the treatment of the CNS disease are acceptable).
Females must be surgically or biologically sterile or postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 months) or if of childbearing potential, must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours before the start of the treatment.

Women of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception during the study and until 3 months after the last treatment. Males must be surgically or biologically sterile or agree to use an adequate method of contraception during the study until 3 months after the last treatment. Adequate methods of contraception include:

Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.
Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.
Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.

Combination of any of the two following:

Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate < 1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.
Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).
Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository in case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill before taking study treatment.
Note: Oral contraceptives are allowed but should be used in conjunction with a barrier method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction. Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.

4. DONOR ELIGIBILITY AND SELECTION

4.1. Donor Selection

Donor evaluation and selection is by standard for normal clinical practice. No study procedures are to be performed on donors. All donors must be willing to donate peripheral blood stem cells and meet institutional or NMDP criteria for donation.

The following prioritization will be used when selecting donors:

When possible, an HLA compatible sibling will be used as a donor.
For patients who do not have an HLA compatible sibling, an unrelated donor will be used
8/8 matched unrelated donors are preferred over single antigen mismatched donors.

If more than one potential volunteer unrelated donor is considered suitable further selection of the most suitable donor is at the discretion of the treating physician. The following serves only as a guide for prioritization:

Age of donor (18-24 > 25-34 > 35-44 > 45+)
Sex and parity of donor (male > female, nulliparous female > parous, multiparous female)

No concurrent active malignancies are allowed on study for >= 2 years prior to treatment start with the exception of currently treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in-situ of the cervix or breast
Patients with known active hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection should be excluded because of potential effects on immune function and/or drug interactions; however, if a patient has HBV history with an undetectable HBV load by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), no liver-related complications, and is on definitive HBV therapy, then he/she would be eligible for study
Patients with known active hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection; patients with a history of HCV infection who received definitive therapy and has an undetectable viral load by PCR would be eligible
Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ipilimumab has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ipilimumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ipilimumab; these potential risks may also apply to decitabine",18,999

NCT02878785,Decitabine and Talazoparib in Untreated AML and R/R AML,true,Acute Myeloid Leukemia,"Inclusion Criteria:

Diagnosis of AML based on 2008 WHO criteria. AML may be de novo, following a prior hematologic disorder, including MDS or Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm, and/or therapy-related.
PHASES 1 AND 2: Patients with AML that has relapsed after, or is refractory to, first-line therapy, with or without subsequent additional therapy, and are currently considered unfit for, or unlikely to respond to, cytotoxic chemotherapy.
PHASE 2 ONLY: Patients previously untreated for AML who are considered unfit for cytotoxic chemotherapy by virtue of performance status, comorbidities, advanced age and/or low likelihood of response based on disease characteristics, or who decline cytotoxic induction chemotherapy.
Patients who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT) are eligible provided that they are ≥ 4 weeks from stem cell infusion.
Patients who have undergone allogeneic SCT (alloSCT) are eligible if they are ≥ 60 days from stem cell infusion, have no evidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD) > Grade 1, and are ≥ 2 weeks off all immunosuppressive therapy.
Previous cytotoxic chemotherapy must have been completed at least 3 weeks and radiotherapy at least 2 weeks prior to Day 1 of treatment on the study, and all adverse events (excluding alopecia) due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier should have recovered to < Grade 1. Patients with hematologic malignancies are expected to have hematologic abnormalities at study entry. Hematologic abnormalities that are thought to be primarily related to leukemia are not considered to be toxicities (AE) and do not need to resolve to < Grade 1.
Prior DNA methyl transferase inhibitor administration (azacitidine, decitabine, or guadecitabine) for AML or for antecedent MDS is allowed if this clinical trial is considered the best treatment option, but azacitidine, decitabine, or guadecitabine must have been stopped at least 3 weeks prior to Day 1 of treatment on the study.
All biologic agents including hematopoietic growth factors must have been stopped at least 1 week prior to Day 1 of treatment on the study.
Age ≥18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of decitabine or talazoparib in patients <18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.
ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%).
Life expectancy of greater than 2 months.

Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits unless thought due to hemolysis or to Gilbert's syndrome;
AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal;
Creatinine within normal institutional limits;

OR

• Creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal.

Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test, and female patients of childbearing potential and male patients must agree to use adequate contraception.

Decitabine has been assigned to pregnancy category D by the FDA. Pregnant women must not take decitabine and female subjects must immediately stop taking decitabine and inform their doctor if they become pregnant during treatment. Decitabine is expected to result in adverse reproductive effects and can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In preclinical studies in mice and rats, decitabine was teratogenic, fetotoxic, and embryotoxic.

Studies in pregnant animals to evaluate the effect of talazoparib on pregnancy have not been performed.

Because decitabine is known to be teratogenic and the effects of talazoparib on the developing human fetus are unknown, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect that she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform the treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of decitabine and talazoparib administration.

It is not known whether decitabine is excreted in human milk. Similarly, studies in lactating animals to evaluate the effect of talazoparib have not been performed, and thus, it is not known whether talazoparib is excreted in human milk.

Plasma Cell Leukemia after initial therapy if achieved at least in partial remission; or relapsed and achieved subsequent remission (CR/PR)
Acquired Bone marrow failure syndromes, except for Fanconi anemia
Myeloproliferative Neoplasms/Myelofibrosis
Other Leukemia Subtypes: A major effort in the field of hematology is to identify patients who are of high risk for treatment failure so that patients can be appropriately stratified to either more (or less) intensive therapy. This effort is continually ongoing and retrospective studies identify new disease features or characteristics that are associated with treatment outcomes. Therefore, if new features are identified after the writing of this protocol, patients can be enrolled with the approval of two members of the study committee.

New Leukemia Subtypes: A major effort in the field of pediatric hematology is to identify patients who are of high risk for treatment failure so that patients can be appropriately stratified to either more (or less) intensive therapy. This effort is continually ongoing and retrospective studies identify new disease features or characteristics that are associated with treatment outcomes. Therefore, if new high risk features are identified after the writing of this protocol, patients can be enrolled with the approval of two members of the study committee.
